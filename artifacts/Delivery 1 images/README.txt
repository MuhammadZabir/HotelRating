<<WILL BE UPDATED>>
Below just a concept. If I fail to find a free workable template, then materialise this concept.

For OVERALL design elements & color, I'd prefer a flat design cos it's trendy & the color palette given is easy to the eyes.
Refer to "Flatly" image. The link below is the free Bootstrap template

Please comment, as I don't have any experience in designing a front-end webpage, so I don't know how detail it is.
<<
For welcoming page, please refer to the "Welcome" image.
at the top navigation bar, there will be (in sequence)
"HOME" icon/link, "Dashboard" icon/link, "sign in/login" icon/link.

At the center of the page, there will be a "search" option 
*PS: just take the "hotels" tab only.
*PS: the link below is the website of the image.

<<
For "search result" page, please refer to "Result" image.
Is it too complicated? I can't decide what element to eliminate.

For "login" or "signup" page, please refer to "Login" image.
Just change the wording of "Login" & "Sign Up" to their respective page.
Just take login/signup by email.

For "userprofile" page, please refer to "User Profile" image.

For "Hotel" page, please refer to "Hotel" image.
Is it too complicated? I can't decide what element to eliminate.
